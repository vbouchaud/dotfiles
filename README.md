# dotfiles

This is basically a stripped down repository of my ~/.config.

## sway

I migrated from awesome to sway not too long ago. Beware of the key bindings I use.

See the [`swayed` PKGBUILD](https://github.com/vbouchaud/aur/blob/main/swayed/PKGBUILD) in my [aur](https://github.com/vbouchaud/aur/) repository to list dependencies that I know of.

## emacs

Just the doom-emacs configuration that I use.

See the [`doomed` PKGBUILD](https://github.com/vbouchaud/aur/blob/main/doomed/PKGBUILD) in my [aur](https://github.com/vbouchaud/aur/) repository to list dependencies that I know of.
